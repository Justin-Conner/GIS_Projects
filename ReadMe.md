This is a demonstartion of using the google API to display a map with custom markers
and a info pop up for forest park.  It is intended to mimick the functionality a
user would experience with the SurCheck tool.  

I choose to use Vanilla Js for this project so the test I wrote must be viewed in the
browser dev tools "console" by opening the file test.html in the root folder.

In a real world setting for Surdex I would be using custom API data from Surdex sources I'm assuming, 
so the API would be different than it is with google.
